# Braz LEMP Docker Image

This repository provides Docker images for LNMP stack (`L`inux, `N`ginx, `M`ariaDB, and `P`HP-FPM), commonly referred to as LEMP.

It is designed to simplify the deployment of PHP applications with a robust and modern environment, offering both **Development** and **Production** versions to meet different deployment needs.

The images are built on top of other modular images from the `fbraz3` ecosystem, ensuring flexibility, maintainability, and ease of use.

üí° For a complete list of available images, please visit the [PHP System Docs](https://github.com/fbraz3/php-system-docs) page.

## Image Versions

This project provides two distinct versions for different use cases:

### Development Version (`-dev` suffix)
- **Purpose**: Designed for local development and testing
- **Features**:
  - MariaDB with **no root password** (empty password)
  - phpMyAdmin accessible at `/pma/` endpoint
  - Relaxed security settings for ease of development
  - Direct database access without authentication

### Production Version (no suffix)
- **Purpose**: Optimized for production environments
- **Features**:
  - MariaDB with **mandatory root password** configuration
  - **Enforced password security**: Container will fail to start if using default password
  - **Custom SQL scripts support**: Execute custom SQL files at startup
  - **No phpMyAdmin** included for security
  - Secure database configuration
  - Root password configurable via environment variables
  - Anonymous users and test databases removed
  - Enhanced security settings

## Tags

The image follows a consistent tagging scheme:

### Base Images (Vanilla LNMP Stack)
- **Production**: `fbraz3/lnmp:{php_version}` (e.g., `8.2`, `8.3`, `8.4`)
- **Development**: `fbraz3/lnmp:{php_version}-dev` (e.g., `8.2-dev`, `8.3-dev`)

### Phalcon Images (With Phalcon Framework)
- **Production**: `fbraz3/lnmp:{php_version}-phalcon` (e.g., `8.2-phalcon`, `8.3-phalcon`)
- **Development**: `fbraz3/lnmp:{php_version}-phalcon-dev` (e.g., `8.2-phalcon-dev`)

### Latest Tags
- `fbraz3/lnmp:latest` - Latest production version
- `fbraz3/lnmp:latest-dev` - Latest development version  
- `fbraz3/lnmp:latest-phalcon` - Latest Phalcon production version
- `fbraz3/lnmp:latest-phalcon-dev` - Latest Phalcon development version

### Architecture Support
- All images support both `amd64` and `arm64` architectures
- LEMP variants are also available as `fbraz3/lemp:{tag}`

## Flavors

This image supports multiple flavors to cater to different use cases:

- **Vanilla**: A standard LNMP stack with no additional frameworks
- **Phalcon**: Includes the Phalcon PHP framework pre-installed

## How to Use

### Development Version

Perfect for local development with easy database access and debugging tools.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  web:
    image: fbraz3/lnmp:8.4-dev  # or fbraz3/lnmp:8.4-phalcon-dev
    volumes:
      - ./:/app/public/
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:80:80"
      - "127.0.0.1:3306:3306"
```

**Access Points:**
- Application: `http://localhost/`
- phpMyAdmin: `http://localhost/pma/`
- Database: `localhost:3306` (user: `root`, password: *empty*)

### Production Version

Secure configuration suitable for production environments.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  web:
    image: fbraz3/lnmp:8.4  # or fbraz3/lnmp:8.4-phalcon
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
    volumes:
      - ./:/app/public/
      - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  mysql_data:
```

**Access Points:**
- Application: `http://your-domain/`
- Database: Internal access only (user: `root`, password: set via environment)

**Important**: Always set a strong `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` in production!

## Custom SQL Scripts

The production images support executing custom SQL scripts during container startup. This feature allows you to initialize your database with custom schema, data, or configuration.

### How to Use Custom SQL Scripts

1. **Create your SQL files**: Place your `.sql` files in a directory on your host system
2. **Mount the directory**: Bind-mount your SQL scripts directory to `/sql-scripts` in the container
3. **Automatic execution**: All `.sql` files in the directory will be executed automatically during first startup

### Example Usage

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  web:
    image: fbraz3/lnmp:8.4
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
    volumes:
      - ./:/app/public/
      - ./sql-scripts:/sql-scripts  # Mount your custom SQL scripts
      - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

```bash
# Directory structure example
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sql-scripts/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01-create-users.sql
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02-create-tables.sql
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 03-insert-data.sql
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
```

### Important Notes

- SQL scripts are executed **only on first startup** (when database is initialized)
- Scripts are executed in **alphabetical order**
- Use numeric prefixes (e.g., `01-`, `02-`) to control execution order
- All scripts run with **root privileges**
- This feature is **only available in production images** for security reasons

## Security Considerations

### Development Version
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never use development images in production**
- Database has no root password
- phpMyAdmin is publicly accessible
- Intended for local development only

### Production Version
- ‚úÖ Secure by default
- Mandatory root password
- No phpMyAdmin interface
- Anonymous users removed
- Test databases removed
- Database binds to localhost only

## Environment Variables

### Production Images

| Variable              | Required | Default               | Description               |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` | Yes      | `defaultrootpassword` | Root password for MariaDB |

**Example:**
```bash
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mySecurePassword123 fbraz3/lnmp:8.4
```

### Development Images

Development images don't require any specific environment variables and work out of the box.

## Manage PHP Directives via Environment Variables

This image allows you to customize PHP directives using environment variables. 

For detailed instructions, refer to the [php-fpm-docker documentation](https://github.com/fbraz3/php-fpm-docker#manage-php-directives-via-environment-variables).

## Cronjobs

Cronjobs can be configured by binding a file to `/cronfile` in the container. The system will automatically install and execute the jobs.

For more details, see the [php-fpm-docker documentation](https://github.com/fbraz3/php-fpm-docker#cronjobs).

## Sending Mails

To enable email sending, this image relies on the configuration provided in the `php-base-docker` project.

Follow the instructions in the [php-base-docker documentation](https://github.com/fbraz3/php-base-docker#sending-mails) to set up email functionality.
